# VaxNLP
A web application that detects anti-vax messages from social media.

Link to the web application: https://vaxnlp.herokuapp.com/ <br> This app allows users to copy and paste a message extracted from social media, and it will inform you whether the message is anti-vaccine or pro-vaccine.

Misinformation regarding vaccination has become a public health problem. Most of the vaccine-related misinformation are spread through social media. The algorithm used for this application could be a useful tool for social media sites (or any website that would like to contribute to eliminate misinformation about vaccine) to filter out the users that spread misinformation. 

Let's all do something about the anti-vaccine movement and make the world safer!

Details regarding source of the data and methods, please see the notes in Jupyter Notebook.
